## The prime directive

&nbsp;

Many, many great minds before me have developed what the [/r/personalfinance](https://reddit.com/r/personalfinance) subreddit deem "the prime directive." This is an absolutely superb resource found through their FAQ (in case they update it, you know where to find it!).

&nbsp;

It is a superb resource that walks you through everything from pulling yourself out of debt all the way through longer term goals like retirement savings. As you can imagine, there's little nuance given its desire to be easy to digest. I absolutely recommend using it as a resource and a communication tool. Where _my article_ will focus is in the final stages talking about immediate goals/early retirement!

&nbsp;

## Savings goal timeline

&nbsp;

### Long term

&nbsp;

Grow that capital! It's ok to take more risk here because your timeline for recovery is longer and therefore a decline in investment value is (while crappy) hopefully temporary. The more your money grows while you're not using it, the better off you'll be! Check out the [asset-allocation](/investments/asset-allocation) section to still make sure you're being reasonable while going after gains.

&nbsp;

It's additionally a good idea to learn about [tax optimizations](/taxation/optimizations) when saving for these goals, as it's a very long game and getting optimal may save you thousands in taxes!

&nbsp;

### Short term (less than 5 years)

&nbsp;

#### Main goal

&nbsp;

**Preservation of capital!** The main point here is that short term savings goals means you want to ensure that when the time comes to spend all those hard earned savings, they'll have a predictable and large enough to achieve the goal. What this boils down to is: don't _lose_ your money. Another way it's commonly stated is "don't chase gains" with the implication that gains run a higher risk of losing the capital in the investment (think stocks).

&nbsp;

It doesn't feel great to save (potentially hundreds of thousands in the case of a Seattle house down payment!) and see the stock market go up 30% in the same time frame. It's easy to focus on what could've been (a lot of gains). However, the thing to also remember is that you could've equally encountered a bear market and lost 30%.

&nbsp;

The problem with the bear market situation, is that bear markets can last years, but your goals may not be flexible enough to overcome such losses. This puts you in a situation where you are having to borrow more, fail to accomplish your goal outright, or lower your expectations. As you can imagine, this is a risk some people are willing to take, and that's fine if they have that necessary flexibility & outlook on their financial picture.

&nbsp;

#### Investments

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, in order to preserve capital you are likely sacrificing returns. High yield savings accounts were only paying 0.4% interest while our down payment sat there. This is one of the better vehicles for the FDIC protection as well as near 0 chance of loss of capital (the USD would basically have to become valueless outright, and there would be bigger problems then!)

&nbsp;

Another option right now, is [I-bonds](/general/i-bonds). Inflation is high and that makes the rate of return on a government backed I-bond up to 11% right now. There is a slight early withdrawal penalty, but the return difference between a HYSA and an I-bond at these rates is substantial.

&nbsp;

Other options are other forms of bonds, money markets, etc, but they are all going to be similarly low returns or carry a risk of default that is higher than I would personally recommend for too little reward.

&nbsp;

#### Decreasing long term savings

&nbsp;

Saving for short term goals likely means redirecting money that would have gone to long term savings elsewhere. This could look like lowering [401k](/tax-advantaged-accounts/401k) contributions, opting not to invest in an [IRA](/tax-advantaged-accounts/ira), etc. You will want to have a clear goal in mind and evaluate your options on which accounts will need to be decreased/excised from your savings plans for the timeframe you're saving. My general recommendation here would be to use the prime directive mentioned above as a proxy for priority in which to stop contributing to! The further down the chart, the less priority.

&nbsp;

As is the purpose for this article...there's some nuance lacking that you could take into account. For instance, it may be better to contribute to your HSA instead of your IRA because that would allow you to cover immediate medical bills in a more tax efficient way while still saving towards your short term savings goal.

&nbsp;

_but I digress (only a little)_

&nbsp;

#### Even more nuance

&nbsp;

So everything above is generally pretty cut and dry. Evaluate your goals, invest/hold accordingly. There are some "fun" (yes I have a sick sense of entertainment) situations to consider...

&nbsp;

##### HSAs

&nbsp;

My article on [Health Savings Accounts](/tax-advantaged-accounts/hsa) talks about them as a retirement vehicle by being able to draw from an HSA for a past medical bill that has yet to be reimbursed from an FSA/HSA. This could be used over the duration of your savings goal (still ensuring capital preservation) in the same fashion to essentially have tax sheltered, and deductible income!

&nbsp;

An example: In 2014, we were saving for a home. I ended up having $2,000 of past medical bills that allowed us to pull $2,000 as a qualified distribution to use on the downpayment for our home. If we use an effective tax rate of 15% or so, that's $300 in tax savings.

&nbsp;

##### IRAs

&nbsp;

IRAs have a specific clause (see [topic no. 557](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc557)) that allows $10,000 to be disbursed from an IRA. If drawn from a Roth IRA (more on Roth treatment later) and there is $10,000 or more in contributions made to that Roth IRA (aka not gains), it is entirely tax and penalty free. Another example: I am going to buy a house in 5 years! Exciting, it's my first! I have enough income to save $6k a year (let's pretend the contribution limit remains fixed). I _could_ contribute $10,000 over the first 2 years into my Roth IRA and let the money grow in that account. At the 5 year mark, I have $12,000 in my Roth IRA. I can pull out $10,000 and keep the $2,000 in my Roth IRA to continue to grow (and never be taxed again!).

&nbsp;

This is a nice balance of saving for your future retirement, maximizing your tax advantage account space, but also accessing those funds without tax/penalty for a home purchase.

&nbsp;

#### Roth _contributions_

&nbsp;

Roth contributions to an IRA (or Roth 401k rollovers that have "seasoned" for 5 years) can be withdrawn without taxes or penalty. What this means is you could potentially access Roth 401k money (or past years' contributions) when you need to withdraw. This starts getting into what I would consider dangerous waters, but for an appropriate circumstance (like longer than anticipated unemployment), it may be worthwhile. Here's why I consider it murky: annual contribution limits are use them or lose them. You cannot return money withdrawn from an IRA/401k, and as such, you are effectively decreasing the amount of tax advantaged space at your disposal. Roth space is really important for withdrawal flexibility when you begin [drawing down your retirement savings](/general/drawdown), so this should not be done lightly (personal opinion here).

&nbsp;

## I have exhausted the basics, what is next?

&nbsp;

Another interesting scenario is when people are starting to hit the edges of tax advantaged space available to them. I consider these to be: HSA, 401k, and IRA. Those are the "core" vehicles in my mind. Many people start to question "what's next?" and it's a very interesting (and awesome!) conundrum.

&nbsp;

First of all, congratulations on the high income/low expense game you're playing. You're rocking it!

&nbsp;

Now comes the fun part, what tools do you have? What state do you live in? How much are you willing to spend? Ethically, what're your thoughts on Panama? (just kidding about that last one)

&nbsp;

### Megabackdoor vs brokerage

&nbsp;

In both cases, you're paying income taxes on your income (after tax 401k contributions, brokerage contributions come from net income). The way to evaluate which one is best for your situation is looking at your timeline & your ability to save.

&nbsp;

From the learnings above, we know that Roth/after-tax 401k contributions rolled into a Roth IRA are tax & penalty free after 5 years. This means, when on the fence about how near you're spending goal is, you could take advantage of a MBDR IRA while still being able to access the contributions tax free after 5 years. You won't be able to access your gains tax/penalty free, but you are also growing your Roth holdings which is beneficial for retirement as discussed elsewhere on this site. Additionally, if you end up being able to save more than anticipated (i.e. unexpected raises/promotions/decreasing your spending), that extra cash flow can fill the need to pull contributions, which means your Roth balance doesn't need to be touched at all. This is an ideal savings situation for retirement, as you're better utilizing tax advantaged accounts at your disposal.

&nbsp;

That said, having excess savings beyond the "core" accounts going into a brokerage is not inherently a bad thing. [Capital gains](/taxation/capital-gains) has preferential tax treatment and tops out at 20% taxes on the gains (you'd have to have substantial income for this, 15% is a more reasonable top % bracket). Additionally, it provides more flexibility by not having to season in an IRA for 5 years, no early withdrawal penalty, you can withdraw any time and only have to pay on the gains for those assets sold (makes paperwork easier!). It's pretty straightforward and is way less of a headache than MBDR + seasoning.

&nbsp;

**Note** I have not delved into many of the details for the following topics, as they are generally later-in-life considerations. Please let me know if there are additional creative solutions I am missing here!

&nbsp;

### Estates

&nbsp;

If your intent is to create an inheritance, then an estate may help ease the tax burden on your beneficiaries. Upon your death, the estate pays all applicable estate taxes (aka from the assets in the estate) and the disbursements from the estate are generally not taxable. Any taxes the estate continues to incur (i.e. dividend disbursements) are taxable events _for the estate_.

&nbsp;

### Insurance


&nbsp;

Depending on your state taxes, sometimes insurance options are the best investment, especially later in life. Some states have inheritance taxes on _property_, of which your direct holdings are. Insurance policies are payouts done by a company to your beneficiary. It's a silly distinction that may be worth looking into depending on your goal! The premium cost may be worth the taxes saved by your beneficiary.

&nbsp;

Other interesting considerations: bankruptcy allows asset seizure to pay any existing debts, but similar to the above, may not apply to certain insurance policies that may be helpful later in life (like disability insurance, long term care, etc).
