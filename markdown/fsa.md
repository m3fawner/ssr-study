# Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)

&nbsp;  

FSAs, or Flexible Spending Accounts, are “use it or lose it” pre-tax accounts. Generally, they are used for medical expenses, but come in a few different varieties. These accounts are owned by your employer, and the contribution amount is fixed to what you select during open enrollment (or any applicable life events). If you leave the company, you forfeit any FSA money.

&nbsp;  

The current limit for a medical FSA is $2,850 per person (this means you cannot have an FSA contribution on behalf of your spouse, but they can have their own FSA).

&nbsp;  

FSA balances must be spent within the tax year, with an exception of $570/year rollover that must be spent within the first quarter of the following year (rollover is subject to employer policy).

## Limited Purpose FSA

&nbsp;  

A limited purpose FSA is an FSA that can be used for only Dental & Vision expenses. This FSA is available to those on high deductible health plans, in addition to their [Health Savings Account (HSA)](/tax-advantaged-accounts/hsa). The same $2,850/person/year applies. You are unable to double dip reimbursements between HSA & LP FSAs, meaning if there are expenses that are able to be reimbursed by HSAs and FSAs, you can only use one or the other. Reimbursing the same expense from both accounts is a form of tax fraud.

## Dependent Care FSA

&nbsp;  

Dependent Care FSAs are available for care expenses for dependents. This can be elderly relatives, disabled relatives, children, etc. The intent of this account is to allow for certain care to be reimbursed in a pre-tax way, generally to allow for the individual to perform work duties. The list of possible reimbursements is very fraught with caveats, so please check your provider’s list of reimbursable expenses to ensure you are able to utilize it effectively.

## Commuter FSA

&nbsp;  

A commuter FSA is used to reimburse commute expenses, up to $280/mo/benefit. This allows employees to have access to pre-tax reimbursements for commuting expenses such as public transportation or parking.
