# RSUs vs options  

&nbsp;

The calculation involved with choosing RSUs vs options is pretty complicated, both in practice as well in taking personal considerations into account. This mental overhead is compounded by the fact that it determines your [equity compensation](/equity-compensation) & is generally fixed for the entirety of the stock grant. This tool can hopefully help visualize and explain how options & RSUs compare and contrast and help visually represent the math.

## How to use this tool

&nbsp;  

This is a rather over-simplified comparison of RSUs vs options in the event of an employer having an exchange of RSUs for options. In the default, it is set to 3 options per RSU, for instance. This has an impact on when the "breakeven" point is, in which the share price going over that point makes options a more lucrative option than RSUs.

&nbsp;  

What it does not account for is the difference in tax treatment between RSUs and options. It is meant purely to visualize the potential value of an RSU or options at a particular price point relative to the grant price.

&nbsp;  

It is to paint a reminder that options are potentially risky (potential zero value) while also providing benefit during an upswing in share price, based on the ratio of options to RSUs available to you.
