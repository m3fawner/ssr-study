#### Arguments for RSUs

**RSUs are guaranteed to be above $0.** Regardless of current market conditions, your shares of RSUs will always be worth something. The best way of looking at RSUs is a bonus, in which you won’t know what $ amount you’ll receive every vesting period. This is the lowest risk option for equity compensation as there is little decision making involved with RSUs.

Generally speaking, **if you are a conservative investor and believe in the value of diversification, RSUs generally fit better with that insight.** You are not reliant upon the company doing well to receive some value. Obviously, we all want our share value to be worth more than less, but options can be truly worthless, whereas RSUs cannot. Some companies offer an exchange of options per RSU to offset the inherent risk (i.e. 3 options per RSU exchanged).

Additionally, RSUs never expire. When the shares are vested, they become yours to do with as you please regardless of employment status or the share price.

#### Arguments for Options

Options are for those who are bullish on their company outlook. You are accepting the risk that this piece of your compensation is worth $0, while being able to accelerate your gains when your options are above water. Abstractly: the math works out to be valueless at the grant price. After the grant price, each option is now worth the difference (i.e. grant of $75 and exercise of $100 means your option has a net value of $25).

<br/>

Options are great for **people who are willing to wait out downturns and are willing to make big bets with a substantial part of their compensation.** A key note is that you should absolutely be careful to live without needing any of the options value as compensation! As you run the risk of them being “below water” and valueless, having it be a necessary part of your income creates huge risk.

<br/>

Additionally, options can expire, and options must be exercised within trading windows. This means converting an option into a share is only available during the available trading windows, and if you leave the company you are forced to either not execute the options or execute them in the quarter following your departure if you want to convert them to a share and realize any value. On the other hand, if there is an incentive to take options and the intent is to stay a long time at the company, those options have a very high likelihood of being worth more than RSUs if the company has even average returns.

#### Tax considerations

Another important consideration is taxation. RSUs are taxed immediately upon vesting, regardless of whether you choose to sell or not, whereas options allow for taxes to be deferred until they are exercised. Options are taxed as income for the difference between the **exercise price** and the **strike price**. At the time of exercise, the cost basis will be set to the exercise price. From there, capital gains taxes are applied (i.e. short & long term considerations).
