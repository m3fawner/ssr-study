# Evaluating a job offer

&nbsp;

  First of all, congratulations on the offer! If you're like me (in software), it was likely brutal getting there. Leetcode much?

  Job offers can be rather complex in terms of how they offer compensation. Recruiters have one job: get you to accept, and accept the lowest offer possible. This leads to an over emphasis on things that may not add a lot of value, or hand wave away details. At the end of the day, your total compensation has many factors, and companies compete on those same factors. This article will provide my perspective on how to look at an offer.

## Get it in writing!

&nbsp;

  Before we dig into the nitty gritty, first and foremost: you must gather all the information that comprises an offer in order to compare apples to apples. **Do not take a recruiter at their word**. They may be great people, honest, accurate, well meaning, but at the end of the day, a verbal offer is not an offer.

  In addition to forcing them to actually write the offer & make it official, it helps you evaluate offers side by side instead of live & on the phone.
