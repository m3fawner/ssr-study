First of all, congratulations on the offer! If you're like me (in software), it was likely brutal getting there. Leetcode much?

Job offers can be rather complex in terms of how they offer compensation. Recruiters have one job: get you to accept, and accept the lowest offer possible. This leads to an over emphasis on things that may not add a lot of value, or hand wave away details. At the end of the day, your total compensation has many factors, and companies compete on those same factors. This article will provide my perspective on how to look at an offer.

&nbsp;

## Get it in writing!

&nbsp;

Before we dig into the nitty gritty, first and foremost: you must gather all the information that comprises an offer in order to compare apples to apples. **Do not take a recruiter at their word**. They may be great people, honest, accurate, well meaning, but at the end of the day, a verbal offer is not an offer.

&nbsp;

In addition to forcing them to actually write the offer & make it official, it helps you evaluate offers side by side instead of live & on the phone. This, for me, was highly important as I'm a details person. I got them to provide their benefits packets (not the brochure, the big ol' packet), offer breakdown (equity, salary, bonus, signing cash), et cetera. For an anxious decision-maker, this is key!

&nbsp;

## The components

Evaluating technical offers is really challenging. For most tech companies, they are [equity heavy](/equity-compensation), have stellar health care (but details that matter), can have cliffs and clawback clauses...all sorts of shenanigans. They are also highly competitive at the moment, so can be shocking to see at first blush! Fight the temptation to look at the big numbers and the fancy charts. Focus on the fundamentals below!

### Salary

&nbsp;

This one is pretty straight forward, thankfully. It is, however, a key component as it drives your most reliable source of income. In the tech world, equity compensation becomes a larger & larger part of your compensation package as you progress in your career. As long as your company is staying afloat, this is practically guaranteed income and does not experience fluctuations like your equity will. If I'm being _really high and mighty_ this is the compensation you should budget with.

&nbsp;

### Equity compensation

&nbsp;

Most of this is covered in the [equity compensation](/equity-compensation) page, but when comparing there's a few important details that may differ from offer to offer. The key among them is going to be private vs public equity. This distinction is the difference between being able to realize your equity compensation on (largely) your own choice. With private equity you are beholden to the company to either go public (IPO) or to raise capital in a fashion that offers a buyback of employee equity.

&nbsp;

Another important detail is the vesting schedule. Some companies have back-weighted vesting schedules (such as Amazon) where you get a pittance of your initial equity in the first year (5%) and 40% in your final two years. Some offers have a one year cliff, which means not receiving equity until the vesting date following your one year anniversary. This gap is generally covered by a [cash signing bonus](#signing-cash), but is something to consider if you rely on equity compensation to make ends meet.

&nbsp;

**Remember** for many, many companies, your initial equity grant may determine the bulk of your equity income. It is important that, when negotiating, you keep this in mind. It's easier for a company to increase your signing equity than say, your salary. There's some inherent risk associated with equity compensation, but your employer also knows that (hence why they're happy to promise a few more shares rather than an equivalent dollar amount ins salary).

&nbsp;

### Cash bonus

&nbsp;

A cash bonus is similar to equity in terms of how I would recommend budgeting around in your financial picture. It's better to assume it doesn't exist than to rely upon it to make ends meet! These bonuses are generally spoken about by recruiters in absolute terms. "Your total compensation will include a cash bonus*"  
*Subject to the company's good graces

Much like equity, this amount could be $0 for a year (in the case of underwater options) or the bulk of your annual earnings (i.e. sales). It's a potentially large dollar amount, but a bird in the hand and all that.

&nbsp;
### Signing cash

&nbsp;

As mentioned in the [equity compensation section](#equity-compensation), signing cash is generally used to persuade people into joining by offsetting equity compensation that may be coming due at the time of the offer. Similar to equity compensation, there can be vesting components to signing cash. It is not unusual to have multiple cliffs of varying dollar amounts in an offer. For instance, some could be vested quarterly, others could be 2 year vests.

&nbsp;

An additional detail with regards to signing cash bonuses is the possibility of a **clawback clause**. A clawback clause means that the company has the right to get their signing cash back from you under certain conditions. An example of a clawback clause reads as follows:

> These sign-on bonus payments are
advances. The First Installment payment will be earned on the first anniversary
following your Start Date. The Second Installment payment will be earned on the
second anniversary following your start date. In the event you voluntarily resign your
employment with or you are terminated for Cause from the Company before the
one-year anniversary of your Start Date, you agree to repay the full amount of the
First Installment at the time of your departure, less 8.33% for each full month of work
completed after your Start Date.

&nbsp;

As you can see, the way the sign on works is that it's considered an advance of payment, where the payment is really "earned" on your 1 year anniversary. These clawbacks are essentially a penalty for quitting prior to the length of the signing cash bonus.

&nbsp;


### Insurance

### Tax advantaged account offerings

### ESPP (Employee stock purchasing program)

&nbsp;

See the [espp section](/equity-compensation/espp).

&nbsp;

**tl;dr;** The benefit of an ESPP can be pretty substantial. It is dependent on the terms of the plan, but can generally be seen as an ROI of (1/(1 - discount %)) per offer period. In the example of an 15% discount on $50,000 annual limit, the worst outcome is an increase in total compensation of $8,825.
