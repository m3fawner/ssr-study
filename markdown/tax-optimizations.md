# Tax optimization

&nbsp;

  Before getting into optimal tax placement of investments, it is worth calling out: if you have tax advantaged space available, it is (almost) always more tax efficient to invest in those! American investment accounts are “use it or lose it” caps, so if you have open cap space in your 401k, IRA, HSA, etc, you should consider using that first.

&nbsp;  

  This article is intended to be paired very closely with [asset allocation](/investments/asset-allocation), as where you place particular asset classes impacts your tax picture.

  [The holy grail of tax optimization](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement). If you have the time, please read the full wiki as it will have much more information than I will provide here. I will provide a tl;dr:

&nbsp;  

Considerations for determining tax optimized investment holdings:
- Tax treatment of the account
- Distributions from the investment (interest, dividends)
- Growth rate of the investment
- Tax treatment of the investment (muni bonds, federal bonds, for instance)
- International holdings (international tax deduction, this only applies to taxable brokerage)

&nbsp;  

At a very high level:
- Roth/HSA (Tax-Free) - High growth investments
- Tax Deferred accounts - High yield (distributions)
- Taxable accounts - low yield, high growth, international, tax advantaged bond holdings 

&nbsp;  

Details:
- **High growth funds should be placed in Roth.** The larger the Roth balance at the time of retirement, the more tax free money can be withdrawn. This is extremely important.
- **If holding low growth investments (bond funds), hold in traditional or taxable brokerage.** Most of us will hold low growth investments. By holding them in traditional accounts, we are decreasing the amount of taxable income (deferred taxation means the lower the balance, the lower the tax liabilities at withdrawal).
- **Capital gains taxes are favorable.** Long term capital gains taxes are treated favorably in tax rate. The highest possible LTCG rate is 20%, far less than many income tax brackets. This means that high growth, low distribution holdings are a good option for holding in taxable accounts, as the only thing more tax efficient on withdrawal is Roth.
- **Investments with high distributions should be held in tax-advantaged accounts.** Since distributions are taxed as income, holding investments with high distributions in taxable accounts means paying income taxes on a larger dollar amount than other types of investments. For instance, Vanguard’s REIT ETF has a 3.53% yield compared to VTI’s yield of 1.63%. For each $100 invested in the REIT, you have $1.90 of taxable income per year more. That is taxed at your top marginal rate. If you hold $10,000 in your account and are at a reasonable 24% tax bracket...that’s $45/yr in tax drag.
- **To address tax drag of distributions, hold high yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.**
Investments with special tax treatment should be held in taxable accounts. Municipal bonds and federal bonds have special tax treatment (federally, interest is not taxed, for instance). This only matters if held in a taxable account, as all distributions in tax-advantaged accounts are not taxable events.

&nbsp;  

  There is a challenge with this approach, though. There is limited tax-advantaged space. As your income increases, the amount of tax-advantaged space decreases further. This means there are limitations on the optimization of tax liabilities.  

&nbsp;  

  In addition, by holding only one asset class in your accounts, it makes it more difficult to [rebalance](/investments/rebalancing) if the market makes a massive shift. For instance, in a raging bull market, I would want to decrease my stock holdings to rebalance more into bonds. If I hold equities only in Roth, I have to rebalance within the Roth account. This goes against the logic above. On the flip side, in a bear market, I would want to increase equities, which means buying equities in a tax deferred account. When the market rebounds, all of that growth will be taking place in traditional, and thus less efficient than Roth.

&nbsp; 

  While these are certainly drawbacks, the long term impact of these situations is likely minimal, and the benefits of having tax efficient investment placement ought to outweigh the impact of rebalancing inefficiently.
