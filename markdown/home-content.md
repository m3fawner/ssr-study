#### Welcome to FIcarious!

&nbsp;  
##### What is this site?

&nbsp;  

  This site is really just a testing ground for technologies I am interested in studying and learning more about. For instance, this is a React Server Side rendered site using Chakra UI. Part of my job is working on interesting web problems, and the best way to come up with solutions is to play around outside of the project. This project is entirely centered around that, for now!

&nbsp;

  What it isn't is monetized. For now, my motivation is purely in spewing information into the world that I've collected up until this point. I don't foresee that changing. Even if I wasn't motivated by the teaching aspect, I'm not sure monetizing would be a driver to put more work into it and I'd rather decommission the site at that point. I have no plans on monetizing and don't get any kick backs from services, funds, or products talked about in the site content.  

&nbsp;  

##### What's here?

&nbsp;  

  My go to hobby has been finances for a very long time. As a result, it's the most "in reach" topic for my test projects. I'll be building out finance tools because it's what I know best and allows me to focus on the code problems and not the product problems. For now, I have a [megabackdoor Roth page](/401k/mega-backdoor-roth) as well as a [net RSU grant proceeds](/equity-compensation/net-proceeds) page because they are common questions I get at work. I'll probably add tools as I take time off (warning, probably very few updates). Check the menu for what's available!

&nbsp;  

##### Why the disclaimer in the footer of every page?

&nbsp;  

  Unfortunately, the world is full of sue happy folks and I need to make it clear that the content of this site is not providing financial advice, but instead informing of the mechanics of the financial world. It is information I have learned as a finance-interested-but-non-finance-professional individual. As such, it may contain errors or mislead unintentionally. I hold myself to a high standard and am always happy to correct the content if information arises that warrants change. If you feel the need to do so, please contact me at [williams.evan.m@gmail.com](mailto:williams.evan.m@gmail.com).

##### About me

&nbsp;

  I make a nerdy joke that "finance is my hobby, and I'm a software developer to pay for it." It may be a bad joke, but it's fitting to my situation. My parents helped instill savings practices while I worked at McDonald's when I was 15, and it has really stuck.  

&nbsp;

  After college I got my first real job and started spending a ton of money (relative to now) on things like a new car, new computer, guitars, a fancy apartment...and it didn't really change my life like I thought it would.  

&nbsp;

  From there I started looking into what I should do with my money and that led me to [/r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance) where I ended up getting the basics and spent a while moderating. After being bored repeating myself about reading the FAQ, I moved on to [/r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence) then started binge reading [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/).  

&nbsp;

  I love teaching what I know to people in all areas of my life and this happens to be one I've spent a lot of time researching. The software side of life also gives me the means to set up this site and create tools that help me provide the lessons in a more easily understood format.

  Hopefully this blurb puts some backdrop to the site & was helpful for at least one reader!
