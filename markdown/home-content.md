#### Welcome to FIcarious!

&nbsp;  
##### What is this site?

&nbsp;  

  This site is really just a testing ground for technologies I am interested in studying and learning more about. For instance, this is a React Server Side rendered site using Chakra UI. Part of my job is working on interesting web problems, and the best way to come up with solutions is to play around outside of the project. This project is entirely centered around that, for now!

&nbsp;  

##### What's here?

&nbsp;  

  My go to hobby has been finances for a very long time. As a result, it's the most "in reach" topic for my test projects. I'll be building out finance tools because it's what I know best and allows me to focus on the code problems and not the product problems. For now, I have a [megabackdoor Roth page](/401k/mega-backdoor-roth) as well as a [net RSU grant proceeds](/equity-compensation/net-proceeds) page because they are common questions I get at work. I'll probably add tools as I take time off (warning, probably very few updates). Check the menu for what's available!

##### Why the disclaimer in the footer of every page?

&nbsp;  

  Unfortunately, the world is full of sue happy folks and I need to make it clear that the content of this site is not providing financial advice, but instead informing of the mechanics of the financial world. It is information I have learned as a finance-interested-but-non-finance-professional individual. As such, it may contain errors or mislead unintentionally. I hold myself to a high standard and am always happy to correct the content if information arises that warrants change. If you feel the need to do so, please contact me at [williams.evan.m@gmail.com](mailto:williams.evan.m@gmail.com).
