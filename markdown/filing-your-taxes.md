# Filing your taxes  

&nbsp;

This is as political as I hope to ever get on this site. Taxes, backdoor mechanisms, investments in general….all have political implications & can be tenuous topics to cover given the wide array of viewpoints. I’ve conveyed what I know about the current system & how things work (to my understanding) and have avoided making statements beyond the mechanics themselves.  

&nbsp;  

However, when it comes to actually filing your taxes, I feel it’s worth shedding that stance for one section.

&nbsp;  

**Please do not use H&R Block or Intuit (TurboTax)**, if you can. These companies have [spent millions of dollars lobbying congress to actively deter steps to make taxes easier to file & free to do so](https://www.propublica.org/series/the-turbotax-trap). While they were a part of the “Free Filing Alliance”, they actively minimized the audience able to use their free service, had deceptive practices to get them to spend money, and then also ensured the IRS could not compete with their own free filing service as a part of the legislation.

While I can’t endorse the product for every situation, [FreeTaxUSA](https://freetaxusa.com/) has been my go-to for 4 years. I have no financial gain by including this reference or affiliation with FreeTaxUSA.
