Donations can be used to lower taxable income. For those who itemize their taxes, donations are less restricted and can be up to 100% of your AGI, if donated in cash. These donations can include cash, physical donations (i.e. Goodwill), certain expenses can be deducted in service of a charity, and assets.  

Under the CARES act, $300 if filing single, or $600 if married filing jointly, can be donated as cash and be deducted without needing to itemize.

## Donations of appreciated assets

&nbsp;  

A compelling way of donating to charity is via appreciated assets. This is easier to convey via examples rather than a block of text. At a high level, charities are tax exempt and, as a result, do not incur taxes on [capital gains](/taxation/capital-gains). What this allows you, as a donor, to do, is to have a tax exempt entity sell the asset for market value, without incurring capital gains taxes.  

&nbsp;  

**Assumptions**  
15% LTCG taxes  
24% Income taxes  
Asset: 10 shares of VTSAX at $100/share, cost basis of $1,000  

&nbsp;  

**Example 1 - Gift of cash via stock sale:**  
Current market value: $115/share  
Total donation value: $1,150  
Capital gains: $150  
Taxes on sale: $22.50  
Taxes deducted: $1,150 * 24% = $276  
Net decrease in taxes: $253.50  

&nbsp;  

**Example 2 - Gift of appreciated stock:**  
Current market value: $115/share  
Total donation value: $1,150  
Taxes deducted: $276  

&nbsp;  

In an itemized deduction situation, the gift of appreciated stock is the clear winner, saving the total capital gains that would have otherwise been incurred. If the standard deduction is used, only $300/$600 can be deducted if in cash, so example 1 may still be worth doing.  

The larger the appreciation, the larger the tax savings for a given donation amount by donating the stock directly vs realizing the gains and donating the cash.  

&nbsp;  

**Example 3 - Gift of cash via depreciated stock:**  
Current market value: $75/share  
Total donation value: $750  
Capital losses: $1,000 - $750 = $250  
Tax deduction for losses: $60  
Tax deduction for donation: $180  
Taxes deducted: $240  

&nbsp;  

**Example 4 - Gift of depreciated stock:**  
Current market value: $75/share  
Total donation value: $750  
Taxes deducted: $180  

&nbsp;  

As you can see, donating depreciated stock does not make sense. The charity somewhat benefits from receiving cash (easier to work with, can buy into VTSAX at market value if they wanted to at that time), and you benefit from the tax deduction of the capital loss + donation.

&nbsp;  

## Donor advised fund

&nbsp;  

Donor advised funds take the concept above, but gives you the ability to control the manner in which the money is donated, when, and to whom it is donated to. These accounts generally come with a slight operating expense (Fidelity is a popular option, and charges $100 or 0.06%, whichever is greater).  

Donations to this fund are immediately tax deductible under the same rules above, allowing you to get the immediate benefit of the donations, but you can still manage the funds. This gives you the ability to do some creative things like establishing a large donation as a part of your will, while getting the tax benefits of the donation while establishing the fund.  

Additionally, since the fund is managed by you & your estate, it can be passed down and the terms of the donations changed based on the successor’s desire.  

&nbsp;  

**An example where this may be worthwhile:**

A family donates $1,000,000 to a donor advised fund (DAF) throughout the years. Along the way, rules are established that every dollar over $1m gets donated to Charity of Evan. Every year, approximately $10,000 gets donated in this example (with no further money needed to be donated, thanks market!).  

After 10 years, there’s $1,000,000 in the DAF, and the Charity of Evan has received $100,000. Unfortunately, the donors pass away at this time, and the DAF gets inherited by their children.  

However, two years after their passing, Charity of Evan makes changes that the children of the donors don’t feel aligned with the wishes of their parents. At this point, the children can redirect the donations to a different charity that does align with the original wishes.  

Had a DAF not been established, it’s probable that the $1,000,000 in donations would have (maybe) gone to Charity of Evan and used to support the change in direction that didn’t align with the wishes of the parents.  
	
Now, while this is a really contrived example, the fund allows the flexibility of establishing a long-lived & evolving donation platform. As the world changes, so do the needs of charities to address new problems, which is a huge plus of this approach!  

&nbsp;  

**Another possible benefit:**  

Let’s say while I was a young investor, I invested in a really terrible fund with a horrible expense ratio of 5.5%, let’s call it EVAN. As I’ve aged, I realize EVAN being held in a brokerage account is a bad idea, because selling it would mean realizing all of its gains over the years. I want to rebalance into VTSAX, but that would mean taking a huge tax hit. I also have plans of setting aside a large amount of money to donate upon my death. I could set aside a dollar amount in my will and let those executing the will come up with it…which may mean selling EVAN and the estate needing to pay capital gains taxes.  
	
If I establish a DAF, I can donate all of my EVAN holdings, get the tax deduction for the donation, and then also immediately sell EVAN in favor of VTSAX inside of the fund, since the DAF is tax exempt.  

Since I had plans to make the donation at the time of my death anyway, the fund can now be paid out entirely to the charity at that time.
