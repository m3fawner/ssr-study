# Emergency Funds

&nbsp;  

  These are great to have! You never know when a world pandemic strikes and you find yourself or your spouse out of a job. Heater on the fritz? Heart attack while in Peru? These things happen, and having cash on hand to make it through tough times allows you to not have to rely upon debt to make it through. While credit cards are great when you pay them off, accruing high interest debt is ruinsome.

  The general recommendation is 3-6 months of living expenses (think rent, food, car payments, but not things like vacations, extravagancies, etc). This is definitely a personal decision. However, the things to take into consideration are: how many people rely upon you, how stable is your job, are you dual income, is your career choice a high demand career. All of these factors will increase/decrease your need for cash on hand.

  I’m pretty conservative, even as dual income with no kids in a high demand career and a wife whose job will always be in demand (social work) and a low spender, we have over 6 months of expenses on hand. This is definitely a cash drag, but may be worth the peace of mind to you.
