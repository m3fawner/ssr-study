  These are great to have! You never know when a world pandemic strikes and you find yourself or your spouse out of a job. Heater on the fritz? Heart attack while in Peru? These things happen, and having cash on hand to make it through tough times allows you to not have to rely upon debt to make it through. While credit cards are great when you pay them off, accruing high interest debt is ruinsome.

&nbsp;  

  The general recommendation is 3-6 months of living expenses (think rent, food, car payments, but not things like vacations, extravagancies, etc). This is definitely a personal decision. However, the things to take into consideration are: how many people rely upon you, how stable is your job, are you dual income, is your career choice a high demand career. All of these factors will increase/decrease your need for cash on hand.

&nbsp;  

  I’m pretty conservative, even as dual income with no kids in a high demand career and a wife whose job will always be in demand (social work) and a low spender, we have over 6 months of expenses on hand. This is definitely a cash drag, but may be worth the peace of mind to you.

## Returns on your emergency funds

&nbsp;  

  I mention above that an emergency fund is a cash drag which has an inherent message underlying the comment. Emergency funds are about preserving your capital, not about seeking returns. The money should be relatively accessible (liquid in investment terms) and should not be at risk of losing substantial value. This is to ensure that, when the unpredictable happens, that it is available to use as planned.

&nbsp;

  I personally keep mine largely in cash. This results in me steadily losing purchasing power to inflation over time. I find it worth the "cost" for the peace of mind, as mentioned earlier. However, there are ways to combat this.

&nbsp;

### Tiered emergency funds

&nbsp;

  Some folks take a tiered emergency fund perspective, where they have cash on hand for a month or two, which helps bridge the gap in the emergency to access less liquid investments. This could allow you to invest a part of your emergency fund in (perhaps) riskier investments to have less of a cash drag.

&nbsp;

### I-Bonds

&nbsp;

  More information can be found via the [i-bonds article](/general/i-bonds) about the mechanics of I-Bonds. How they fit into an emergency fund is that they explicitly are tied to inflation and therefore don't lose (as much) purchasing power.

&nbsp;

### Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)

&nbsp;

  A HELOC is a line of credit against your home in order to access equity. It generally comes with a small fee to keep the line of credit open and then charges a small interest rate on the balance carried. **You are putting your house on collateral**, that is why it bears a lower interest rate than say, a credit card, because it is a secured loan.

&nbsp;

  One thing of note: HELOCs are entirely at the discretion of the lender to keep open. When COVID first hit, many people's line of credit were closed because of high demand on the banks to issue the credit. This means if macro-economic hardship hits, it is not a substantially reliable emergency fund.
